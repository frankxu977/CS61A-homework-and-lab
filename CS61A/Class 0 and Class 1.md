### 1.2   Elements of Programming

- **primitive expressions and statements**, which represent the simplest building blocks that the language provides,
- **means of combination**, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and
- **means of abstraction**, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.

### 1.2.2   Call Expressions

The most important kind of compound expression is a _call expression_, which applies a function to some arguments.

There is no limit (in principle) to the depth of such nesting and to the overall complexity of the expressions that the Python interpreter can evaluate.

### 1.2.3   Importing Library Functions

An import statement designates a module name (e.g., operator or math), and then lists the named attributes of that module to import (e.g., sqrt). Once a function is imported, it can be called multiple times.

### 1.2.4   Names and the Environment

A critical aspect of a programming language is the means it provides for using names to refer to computational objects. If a value has been given a name, we say that the name _binds_ to the value.

In Python, names are often called ==_variable names_ or _variables_== because they can be bound to different values in the course of executing a program. When a name is bound to a new value through assignment, it is ==no longer bound to any previous value.== One can even bind built-in names to new values.
